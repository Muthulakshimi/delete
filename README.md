**<h3>The end goal: To make the job of announcing an event easier for the organisers in every level with just one click!!!</h3>**

<p>Problem Statement: We got the idea of making the process of organising the event easier through AWS, everytime the organiser plans an event he'll have to make the announcement in every social media available to get the concentrated crowd from all sources hence this idea of one-click announcement popped up!! In here all the organiser has got to do is to post his plan for event with some description such as his name, e-mail id, message and picture related to his event and with one-click he'll get it posted in all platforms... </p>
